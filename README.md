## File Description




## Compile and Run
  
  Writing C# Programs on Linux:
  
  Mono is an open-source version of the .NET Framework which includes a C# compiler and runs on several operating systems, including various flavors of Linux and Mac OS. Check for [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/).
  
  To Compile:
  
  > **mcs TripleDES.cs**
  
  The compiler will create **"TripleDES.exe"**, which you can run using:
  
  > **mono TripleDES.exe**
